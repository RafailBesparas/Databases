# 🏭 Factory-Database-System

A smart, automated relational database system to supercharge factory operations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project delivers a robust **relational database system** tailored for a factory environment. By integrating **automated triggers**, **foreign keys**, and **stored procedures**, the system minimizes manual input, optimizes workflows, and reduces operational costs.

Think of it as a digital backbone for **production**, **maintenance**, and **inventory**—all in one place.

---

## ⚙️ The Problem

Manual tracking is slowing the factory down:

- **Production bottlenecks** due to inconsistent, manual record-keeping  
- **Machine downtime** caused by uncoordinated maintenance schedules  
- **Inventory chaos** — overstocking, understocking, always at the wrong time  

These issues drive up costs, waste resources, and hurt productivity.

## 💡 The Solution

A centralized, automated relational database that:

- **Tracks production** in real-time — what’s made, when, and how much  
- **Automates maintenance** — triggers keep maintenance timely and machines operational  
- **Optimizes inventory** — live stock levels with alerts before you run dry  

All powered by:

- **Foreign Keys** for relational integrity  
- **Triggers** for event-based automation  
- **Stored Procedures** for repetitive task handling

## 📐 Project Scope

- **Database Design**:  
  Tables for `Employees`, `Machines`, `Production`, `Inventory`, and `Maintenance`
  
- **Automation Features**:  
  - Triggers for inventory updates and machine status changes  
  - Stored procedures for reporting, replenishment, and maintenance scheduling  

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Foreign Keys**: Enforce consistent and valid relationships between tables  
- **Triggers**: Automate real-time updates to key fields like machine status and stock levels  
- **Stored Procedures**: Handle complex workflows like monthly reporting and task assignment  

---

## ✅ Benefits

- **Reduced Downtime**: Machines are serviced on time  
- **Increased Efficiency**: Accurate, automated tracking reduces manual errors  
- **Cost Savings**: Lower operational costs through optimized resource usage  

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- **Data Integrity Risks**: Foreign keys ensure all data remains valid and properly linked  
- **Automation Failures**: Triggers and procedures undergo thorough testing for reliability  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This isn’t just a database — it’s a **factory upgrade**. Automate key processes, cut manual overhead, and drive productivity. With smarter systems in place, the factory runs **leaner**, **faster**, and **more profitably**.
